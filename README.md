# College Connect: Unified Notification System

## üåü Overview

**College Connect** is a responsive, single-page web application designed to serve as a unified platform for colleges to disseminate announcements, notifications, events, and exam schedules to their students. It features role-based authentication, providing a tailored dashboard experience for both students and administrators.

The application is built using a pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript stack, utilizing the browser's `localStorage` for client-side data persistence in this demo environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/virajj12/College-Connect.git](https://github.com/virajj12/College-Connect.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd College-Connect

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Backend Functionality

Please note that this is a client-side demo. The **Forgot Password** functionality, while implemented with a form and a mock API call, is non-functional in this demo. The script includes an alert stating: `"This is a demo. Email functionality requires a server."`. For production use, a secure backend API would be required to handle user authentication, password reset emails, and persistent database storage.
